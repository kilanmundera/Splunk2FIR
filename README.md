# Splunk2FIR

The **Splunk2FIR** Splunk application provides a custom command that integrates with [FIR (Fast Incident Response)](https://github.com/certsocietegenerale/FIR) to automatically create nuggets based on Splunk search results. It leverages a Python script to send data from Splunk to FIR.

## Features
- Creates nuggets in FIR using search results from Splunk.
- Includes a custom macro for easier integration into Splunk queries.
- Automatically imports _time and _raw fields from Splunk into FIR for accurate timestamping, detailed logging, and seamless integration of the logs into the Timeline of the incident in FIRâ€”allowing for better incident tracking and analysis.

## Installation and Configuration
### 1. Download and Install the App:
- Download the app package (`Splunk2FIR.spl`) from the [Releases page](https://github.com/kilanmundera/Splunk2FIR/releases).
- Log in to your Splunk instance and navigate to **Apps > Manage Apps**.
- Click **Install app from file**, then select the `.spl` file and upload it.
- Click **Install** to complete the process.

### 2. Setting FIR URL and API Token
The `splunk2fir.py` script is located in the app's `bin/` directory. This script handles the communication between Splunk and FIR, sending data via HTTP POST requests.

You must set the FIR instance URL and the API token :

- **FIR URL**: Modify the `FIR_NUGGETS_URL` variable to point to your FIR instance's API endpoint.
- **API Token**: Update the `API_TOKEN` variable with your FIR API token.

## Debugging and Logs
The script includes logging functionality (commented out by default). If you need to enable logging, uncomment the `logging.*` lines and adjust the log file path if necessary.

## Usage
### **Using the `splunk2fir` Custom Command with the `splunk2fir(2)` Macro**

The app provides a macro called `splunk2fir(2)` for easier usage in Splunk searches. This macro is used to simplify the process of passing values to FIR.

#### Arguments:
- `fir_id`: The ID of the FIR incident.
- `fir_interpretation`: The description or interpretation of the event to be sent to FIR. Must be double quoted.


### Example SPL Search with Macro:
```spl
index=your_index sourcetype=your_sourcetype
| [...] (An SPL query to isolate the event(s) you'd like to push as a nugget; one nugget per event)
| `splunk2fir("1", "Test nugget from Splunk")`
```

This will automatically convert the required fields and pass them to the `splunk2fir` command behind the scenes.

### **The `splunk2fir` Custom Command**
The `splunk2fir(2)` macro calls the `splunk2fir` command that launches the Python script `splunk2fir.py`.

### The Python Script (`splunk2fir.py`)
The `splunk2fir.py` script is located in the app's `bin/` directory. This script handles the communication between Splunk and FIR, sending data via HTTP POST requests.

The script expects the following arguments:

- **arg1**: The raw data of the event (the `_raw` field, automaticaly extracted)
- **arg2**: The event timestamp (the `_time` field, automaticaly extracted).
- **arg3**: The FIR incident ID (the first argument of the `splunk2fir(2)` macro)
- **arg4**: The nugget description (the second argument of the `splunk2fir(2)` macro)

You can debug or test the script manually by setting environment variables:
```bash
export SPLUNK_ARG_8="raw event data"
export SPLUNK_ARG_9=$(date +%s)  # Current Unix timestamp
export SPLUNK_ARG_10="1"  # FIR incident ID
export SPLUNK_ARG_11="Test description"
python3 /path/to/splunk2fir.py
```
